### Project Description
A website like ETLAB but instead the students mark the attendance of teachers, rank them based on their lectures for the day. We also get to give anonymous feedback too! Look who's the boss now??

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who doesn't want to rate 0 stars for that boring lecture last Monday??

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A website with basic login and an interface in which we can mark attendance, rate and give a feedback for the faculty based on our daily time table.
